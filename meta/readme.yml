    Generate Role markdown file (README.md) from meta data and a template.
    Inspired by and based on Jason Edelman's
    [ansible-webdocs](https://github.com/jedelman8/ansible-webdocs).
    

    Notes:
    
    - Since markdown and jinja are "funny", you may need extra
    [line breaks](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet#lines) and
    [escaping](http://jinja.pocoo.org/docs/2.10/templates/#escaping) to get things just right.

    - You can omit any variables in readme.yml, which will
    result in empty sections.

  requirements: >-
    Copy **_readme.yml_** to role meta/ directory for every
    role.  Complete/Modify variable values as necessary.

  role_variables:
    - name: mr_path_to_roles
      required: yes
      default: "first path in roles_path"

        The path to your roles.  [DEFAULT_ROLES_PATH](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/reference_appendices/config.html#default-roles-path)
        is used in defaults/main.yml
    - name: mr_md_filename
      required: yes

  example_playbook_text: >-
    Maybe you want to place some extra text here to explain
    the following examples.

      code_block: >-
        - name: Generate Role(s) README.md

          tasks:
