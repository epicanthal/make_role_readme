    Generate Role markdown file (README.md) from meta data and a template.
    Inspired by and based on Jason Edelman's
    [ansible-webdocs](https://github.com/jedelman8/ansible-webdocs).
    
    - Goal:  Keep a somewhat consistent format for README.md and as
      Mr. Edelman states " if I didnâ€™t end up creating this, I would
      have spent a ton of time manually creating tables in markdown
      one at a time for each <role> I was building! And just imagine
      making a small change like adding a row or column to each one!"

    - Notes:
    
        - Since markdown and jinja are "funny", you may need extra
          [line breaks](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet#lines) and
          [escaping](http://jinja.pocoo.org/docs/2.10/templates/#escaping) to get things just right.

        - You can omit any variables in readme.yml, which will
          result in empty sections.

        - **_choices_** for a variable are supplied as a list.

        - Look at meta/readme.yml from this role to see how it was used to
          generate this README.md

  requirements: >-
    Copy **_readme.yml_** skeleton to role meta/ directory for every
    role.  Modify as necessary.

  role_variables:
    - name: mr_path_to_roles
      required: yes
      default: '**_first path in roles_path_**'
      choices: []
      comments: >-
        The path to your roles.  [DEFAULT_ROLES_PATH](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/reference_appendices/config.html#default-roles-path)
        is used in defaults/main.yml
    - name: mr_md_filename
      required: yes
      default: README.md
      choices: []
      comments: The name of the markdown file to be generated.  
    - name: mr_role_name
      required: yes
      default:
      choices: []
      comments: The name of the role.

  dependencies: >-
    You can place a list of galaxy roles here
    (use extra line breaks as necessary):

    - example.dependency_role1

    - example.dependency_role2

  example_playbook_text: >-
    Maybe you want to place some extra text here to explain
    the following examples.

  example_playbooks:
    - description: Create README.md for role 'aci_build'
      code_block: >-
        - name: Generate Role(s) README.md
          hosts: localhost
          connection: local
          gather_facts: yes

          tasks:
            - name: include 'make_role_readme'
              include_role:
                name: make_role_readme
              vars:
                mr_role_name: aci_build

    - description: Supply a path to role(s)
      code_block: >-
        - name: include 'make_role_readme'
          include_role:
            name: make_role_readme
          vars:
            mr_role_name: aci_build
            mr_path_to_roles: /aci_project/roles

    - description: >-
        Loop through multiple roles to create a README.md for each.

        * Caveat - [Escaping](http://jinja.pocoo.org/docs/2.10/templates/#escaping)
        may be necessary in readme.yml.
      code_block: >-
        - name: Generate Role(s) README.md
          hosts: localhost
          connection: local
          gather_facts: yes

          vars:
            mr_role_names:
              - make_role_readme
              - another_role
              - yet_another_role

          tasks:
            - name: include 'make_role_readme'
              include_role:
                name: make_role_readme
              vars:
                mr_role_name: "{{ '{{' }} mr_role_names_item }}"
              loop: "{{ '{{' }} mr_role_names }}"
              loop_control:
                loop_var: mr_role_names_item
